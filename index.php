        During this session you should imagine that you are this user and use the information provided on the
        profile page to help you judge the recommendations you see.
    </p>
    <p>Your as you view each recommendation and itâ€™s set of explanations you will be asked a series of survey
        questions that are designed to help gauge how your trust and understanding of the recommendation system
        is affected by each new recommendation.
    </p>
    <p>
